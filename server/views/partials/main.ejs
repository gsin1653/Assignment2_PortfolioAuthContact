    <p>Hello! ðŸ˜Š Thank you for visiting my web portfolio it means a lot to me. I have built this website in
        the past three weeks, using several different technologies and frameworks. My initial commit to the
        project's repository was Jan 30th, and it was presented on Feb 14th.</p>

    <p>For the front-end, I utilized the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> toolkit.</p>

    <p>For the back-end, I am using <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> with the <a
            href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> framework on top, as well as <a href="https://ejs.co/">Embedded
            JavaScript Templating</a> as my template engine.</p>

    <p>Additionally, I am using the NPM packages <a href="https://eslint.org/">ESLint</a></p>

    <p>Finally, this website is currently being deployed on <a href="https:/heroku.com">Heroku</a> under a free Dyno
        plan, so I apologize for any issues regarding speed or connectivity!</p>

    <h3 id="explanation">Why This?</h3>

    <p>I decided to build my own web portfolio as the subject of this project to further my knowledge regarding back-end
        web technologies, while creating something that will be beneficial to my career. I hope that this demonstrative,
        visually-appealing website exemplifies my talents and character, as well as opens up opportunities to network
        with others.</p>

    <p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Through sheer luck, I managed to get my initial objectives set for this website
        completed on time, and in a presentable fashion. However, compared to the scope (and importance),
        I feel like there is a lot currently lacking. In theory, an informational website such as
        this could be displayed completely statically, not requiring such a robust back-end. </p>

    <p>If I had extended time, I would have added an actual database component (Eg. MySQL or MogoDB) instead of static
        data
        files. </p>

    <h3 id="pages">Current Pages</h3>

    <p>Currently, there are five separate pages on this website to demonstrate different features and functionality
        within the scope of the described framework:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="/home">Home:</a>It include a Navigation Bar or other Navigation scheme
            that allows the user to view each page of my site is an example of a static webpage.</li>
        <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="/about">About:</a>It include My legal name, an image of me, a short
            paragraph about me. and it also include a link to a PDF version of my Resume</li>
        <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="/project">Project:</a> It include images and information for 3 Projects.
            Having some current projects working on or past projects completed. Include an image for each Project and a
            short description of role and the outcome.</li>
        <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="/services">Service:</a> It include a short list of services I offer (e.g.
            General Programming, Web Development, Automation etc.). Including images and details </li>
        <li><a class="font-weight-bold" href="/contact">Contact:</a> It include my contact information in a panel. Also
            includes a short interactive form that allows the user send me a message and provide basic contact
            information (First Name, Last Name, Contact Number, Email Address, Message, etc.). This form is not fully
            functional initially. However, it is able to capture the information entered by the user and redirect them
            back to the Home Page and show a succes message. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="more-information">More Information</h2>

    <p>This project is a collaboration between that aims to teach students the entirety of the spectrum of
        full-stack web development, starting with the visuals and UX.</p>
